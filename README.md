# underscore-dev

## Description

This is a small repo for the purpose of investigating functional programming using Underscore.

Ideally I will progress to Lo-dash but for the time-being I am following examples from  Alex Pop's book "[Learning Underscore.js](http://bit.ly/1JwvBOO)". 

Also, I found a good way to generate random data - [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com).


I'll use Angular 1.5

Following the setup notes using Brofor [Angular Structure](https://omarfouad.com)


## Project structure

Ideally I would like to create a Component Structure, unfortunately setting up the browserify dependencies was a distraction, and I'm currently adding the underscore library directly into the html page and using the global _ property in the Window object.
