# underscore-dev

## Description

This is a small repo for the purpose of investigating functional programming using Underscore.

Ideally I will progress to Lo-dash but for the time-being I am following examples from  Alex Pop's book "[Learning Underscore.js](http://bit.ly/1JwvBOO)". 

Also, I found a good way to generate random data - [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com).
